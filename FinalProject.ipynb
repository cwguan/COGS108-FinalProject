    "We are interested in analyzing the prevalence of obesity in the United States and how it is influenced by environmental and educational factors. A sedentary lifestyle has become the norm for most working Americans. Much of their time is spent sitting either at work or at home. Due to demanding work schedules, people lack the time and energy to pursue active lifestyles. The modern work life has also contributed to poor eating habits characterized by high calorie foods and large portion sizes. People in general do not have time to prepare healthy, home cooked meals every day. The convenience of fast food has made it a popular alternative. Lack of physical activity and poor diet choices have largely influenced obesity in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to better understand the factors that correlate to obesity. There have been various studies done in the past showing a high correlation between income and obesity. So instead we wanted to focus on factors that do not have obvious correlation to obesity level such as education level, recreation/gym facility density, and access to stores. "

    "\"Inequality in the Built Environment Underlies Key Health Disparities\" describes a study conducted at the University of Minnesota that aimed to assess the geographic and social distributions of physical activity facilities and their relationship to obesity. It was revealed that groups with lower socio-economic status were less likely to have facilities around their neighborhoods, which in turn was associated with decreased physical activity and increased overweight.\n",
    "\n",
    "In \"Neighborhood Impact on Healthy Food Availability and Pricing in Food Stores,\" the author examines the impact of price and availability of healthy food in food stores and its correlation to obesity, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The study indicated that a key factor in obesity prevention is the accessibility to grocery stores with healthy food options; however, large chain supermarkets stray away from opening in lower income neighborhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although, education allows for more food opportunities, Micheal Gard and Jan Wright's study described in \"Managing Uncertainty: Obesity Discourses and Physical Education in a Risk Society\" argues how \n",
    "how obesity could be a product of expert knowledge taught in physical education classes; this may construct anxiety surrounding body images, and in turn be detrimental to students. We want to examine the consequences and possible correlations between education and obesity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite fitness facility density being correlated to socio-economic status, we will not analyze income as a determining factor for obesity. We aim to find the correlation between factors that directly influence obesity, such as access to grocery stores and gym facilities. It is likely that easier access to these things will enable people to choose healthier lifestyles, thereby preventing obesity. There is insufficient evidence that obesity is directly caused by socio-economic status, but with sufficient data analysis, it is possible to show causation with the other factors previously mentioned. \n",
    "\n",
    "Various studies have also shown that obesity is correlated with education. Individuals with lower income or education levels are more likely to suffer from obesity due to their lack of awareness on harmful eating habits and their inability to afford healthier food options. \n",

    "We hypothesize that higher education would negatively correlate with obesity the most. Higher education leads to higher paying jobs and thus more opportunities and economic freedom to buy healthier food option. Because eating healthy is often more expensive in the United States, people with lower incomes or less education are more likely to lean towards cheaper fast food options. "

Coming from a federal government department, it is a trustworthy dataset that will provide us granular and enough data to be able to draw conclusions on our question.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Food Environment Atlas provides us with 278 variables that we can use to analyze and help us answer our question. Although we might use more factors available to us in this dataset as we continue to work on the project, we wanted to focus on a smaller number to begin with. In particular, these variables aim to give us a better idea of what kind of resources are available to each county. We will utilize the “population count in 2015 that have low access to stores” and the “number of recreation & fitness facilities per 1000 people in 2014” to have some insight on the infrastructure in each area and how they may affect obesity levels. Other variables that are left to our disposal include the poverty rate, percentage of various races, and food-assistance program participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Education dataset has 31 variables, corresponding to various years that data was collected and 4 different levels of education: less than high school diploma, high school diploma, some college, and Bachelor's degree or higher. These 4 levels are described with percentage of adults and population count who have achieved the different levels of education. Because we also wanted to consider factors that are not directly related to food and health, analyzing a population’s education level would produce new insights into if it is a factor in or has a correlation to obesity. \n",
